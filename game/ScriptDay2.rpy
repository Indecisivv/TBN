    "Frantic footsteps and the startled voices of your companions wake you up."

    "You run out to see what happened."

    Kobold "P-please, don't hurt me! I only meant-"

    "A small, trembling kobold clutches a carriage wheel, your carriage's wheel, eyes flicking between the angry faces surrounding him."

    "[darcey_name] is pointing her spear at him, pinning him against a tree."

    Darcey "Save it! Who would trust a thief?"

    Iris "Explain yourself. Why do you have our wheel?"

    Kobold "I—I'm sorry! My clan- we're starving!" 
    
    Kobold "I thought... I thought, if I took just one wheel, I could trade it for food."

    Quinn "There are other ways besides stealing. Asking for example."

    Plo "In the middle of the desert at midnight? Hah, you'd be lucky if we handed you a loaf of stale bread."

    Darcey "Save your excuses. You're lucky I didn't spear you where you stood."

    Kobold "No spear, please! I'm truly sorry! I'll make it right—"

    "The kobold bows his head and trembles. For a moment, it seems the tension might ease."

            Kobold "Rations? Really? Thank you! Thank you—"
            Darcey "What? Why would we do that?"
            Iris "[darcey_name]."
            "[darcey_name] steps forward towards the kobold, fishing a few pieces of jerky from her pack."
            Darcey "Here. Take this. But promise you won't come near us again."
            kobold "I promise! Thank you!"
            "[darcey_name] hands over the food and reaches for the wheel."
            "The kobold has other plans. He quickly scoops up the wheel once he has the food secured and bolts without a word."
            Darcey "HEY!"
            "You shout after him, but he's already halfway down a sandy slope."
            #TODO: animation here, make it feel engaging
            "The kobold trips over a rock. The wheel tumbles from his arms."
            "You hear the sickening snap as the wheel splinters against a nearby stone."
            Kobold "Gah!"
            Plo "OUR WHEEL!"

            "The kobold disappears into the darkness."
            Quinn "No use. Capturing him won't un-break the wheel."

            Kobold "Y-yes! Yes, I'll drop it! Please!"
            "He steps back as if to find a suitable distance to lay down the wheel."
            #TODO: animation, him backing away
            "The kobold has other plans. As he turns to flee, the weight of the wheel sends him tumbling and escapes his grip."
            "You hear the wheel splintering as it lands on a stone."
            Kobold "No! My wheel—"
            Plo "{i}OUR{/i} wheel!"
            Darcey "Get back here!"
            "[quinn_name] aims his bow at the fleeing kobold, hesitates, then lowers it."
            Quinn "No use. Capturing him won't un-break the wheel."
            "The kobold disappears into the darkness."
            

    "Dawn breaks over the sand as the party gathers around the shattered wheel."

    #TODO: Show the wheel cg

    Quinn "The wheel... it's completely shattered."

    Plo "Is there a way to fix? No way am I walking all the way in that {i}sand{/i}."

    Darcey "We'll make it work. We've faced worse."

    "The group packs up camp as the sun climbs higher, ready to face the long day ahead."
    "The kobold's fate is unknown, but their own journey must continue."
